# Your Typical Template

Your Typical Template is a minimal Vuejs template built on Vue 3(duh) and  the Bootstrap 5 design system. As the name suggests, it is a typical template, built with ready-made components to allow you to have a jump-start to your projects. Some of the components have been automated, so that they can be highly reusable.

This template is also built to be minimal too. Whatever Bootstrap 5 classes can do, we've show preference to that against custom CSS classes. You don't need to invest a lot of time to learn how to use it to make code changes

The UI design is also designed to be minimal, so that you can make the template anything you want it to be, as fast as possible.
